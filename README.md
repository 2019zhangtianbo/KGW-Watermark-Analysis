# KGW-Watermark-Analysis

This repository provides a complete implementation of the **KGW watermarking algorithm** applied to multiple pretrained summarization models (T5, Flan-T5, BART, PEGASUS). It supports:

- Watermarked and unwatermarked summary generation  
- Long-document hierarchical summarization  
- Watermark detection via z-scores  
- ROUGE & BERTScore-based quality evaluation  
- Aggregated analytics into Excel
